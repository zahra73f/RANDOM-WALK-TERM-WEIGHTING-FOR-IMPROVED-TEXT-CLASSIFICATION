# Random-walk-term-weighting-for-improved-text-classification

1. New approach for estimating term weights in a document 
2. New weighting scheme can be used to improve the accuracy of a text classifier
3. The method uses term co-occurrence as a measure of dependency between word features
4. A random walk model is applied on a graph encoding words and co-occurrence 
dependencies, resulting in scores that represent a quantification of how a particular word 
feature contributes to a given context

## Algorithm

All the algorithms are explained in [Random-walk-term-weighting-for-improved-text-classification](./article.pdf).
